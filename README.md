# 🧠 TypeScript Learning Projects

Welcome to my TypeScript learning repository!  
This monorepo contains mini-projects and exercises I built to practice and master TypeScript.

Each folder inside represents a standalone project with its own purpose, dependencies, and README file.

## Projects

| #   | Project Name       | Description                         |
|-----|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 01  | [Quran Tracker](./01-quran-tracker) | Simple CLI tool to track Quran reading progress |

### How to Use
❗ Since each project is unique, you can view complete installation information for each project folder.
